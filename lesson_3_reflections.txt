When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

--  I will use the remote repository if I want other users to view my work or if I want others to help me with a
project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

--  Git might pull changes while I am busy working on files and I might loose all my work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

--  Forks: This is a repository that is cloned from one user's repository to another user's repository and both
exists on GitHub. This would only be used when I want to make a clone/copy of someone else repository to work on.
--  Clone: This is a duplicate of the remote repository that exists on your local machine. This would only be used
when you are collaborating with others on the remote repository.
--  Branches: This is basicly a different version of your repository. This would only be used if you want to test
code before integrating it into the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

-- It keeps you updated with any changes that were made.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

-- Without Git or Github I would have to wait for the other person to finish working on a file before I can continue
working on that same file. That would be harder than using Git Github which allows you to work on the same file and
merge those files.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
