How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

-- The diff command showed me the line numbers where the content was different between the two files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

 -- I will be able to revert back to an older version that worked. I can compare 2 versions of a file for any changes that were made.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

-- When you choose to manually commit after a logical change in the code you avoid having a cluttered version of the changes you made. Your versions are more easily managed.
-- When your versions are automatically saved, like Google, you risk saving incomplete code. It might also save too many versions. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

-- Saving multiple files in one commit is good when the changes in the files are linked to each other. It allows the user to track changes in code regarding a specific process.
-- Saving each file seperately allow only review of that specific file and there for cannot track other files that are related to that file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

-- You can use the git log to have a view of all the git commits that you have made. The git diff can be used to view changes within the commits that you have made.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

-- Version control allows me to revert my code back to a previous version that worked. So, in essense, I can be more confident when I implement new code. Even if the new code were to break the system, I can go back to a version that worked previously.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

-- I'm not sure what the use of the staging server is yet. As far as I can see I cannot preview/browse these files within my browser. Can I? I would think that I can view all these files within my broser for testing right out of my working golder.
